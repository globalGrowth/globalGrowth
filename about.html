<p> <a name="q1"> <h1>What is globalGrowth? </h1> <br />globalGrowth is an ERC 20 token pegged to the inverse of the current carbon-dioxide (CO2) levels reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at their observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, USA. <b> So what this means is that when the CO2 levels decrease, the price of the token will rise and if the CO2 levels were to increase, the price of the token will go down. </b> The movement of the price is all based on the formula written at the bottom of the Price Data page.

<p> <a name="q2"> <h1> What is the plan? </h1> <br /> The whole idea behind globalGrowth to incentivise the public in decreasing their own individual CO2 output. A holder of the token will most likely rethink their daily habits and decrease their CO2 output because it will benefit them financially. Though one person exchanging their lifestyle for a more environmentally friendly one will most likely not have a huge effect on the global CO2 levels, if we can encourage many people to change their habits by making a financial incentive, we might actually see some progress. So, for what might be the first time ever, humans will benefit financially in helping improve our environment.

<p> <a name="q3"> <h1> Why are we doing this? </h1> <br />It is true that there are natural activities that release CO2 into our atmosphere like volcanic eruptions and cellular respiration, but CO2 is released at a pace in which the levels can be checked, i.e. through photosynthesis. But, when you begin burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees at such a rapid rate that the Earth can no longer keep the CO2 levels in check, the levels begin to rise. As of August 2019, the CO2 levels reached 410 parts per million (ppm) versus 387 ppm in 1999 and 353 ppm in 1989 (NOAA). CO2, being a greenhouse gas, traps heat in our atmosphere which will cause global temperature to rise to unprecedented heights. This will increase the severity of storms and wildfires, encourage the spread of disease and infection, kill ocean life and bleach coral reefs, and cause sea levels to rise. We have already seen the impact these effects have had on our society, but unless we try to halt the increase of CO2 in our atmosphere, they will only occur more often and more severe. That is where globalGrowth comes in. </a> </p>

<p> <a name="q4"> <h1> How can I buy a globalGrowth token? </h1> <br />In order to receive a globalGrowth token, you will send an amount of Ethereum to our address 0xaeD4e4eB97343d3638F9c0D1364BF8aebB0F73E6 and we will send the corresponding amount of tokens to you based on the exchange rate at the time you sent us your Ethereum. Thanks to the Ethereum blockchain network, there is a permanent and unchangeable ledger of all requests so please contact us at (email) if there are any mistakes on are part. Please do allow time for pending. </a> </p>

<p> <a name="q5"> <h1> How can I decrease my daily CO2 output? </h1> <br />There are many ways you can decrease your daily CO2 output and here are just a select few that are generally easy to accomplish: Eat more locally grown vegetables, fruits, and grains, lower your consumption of livestock and its byproducts such as meat and dairy, buy less fast fashion and rather buy recycled clothing, switch off lights and unplug electronic devices when not using them, drive less and walk more, take public transportation or join a carpool, and avoid air travel, if possible. It is tough to make such a drastic change to your lifestyle all while acknowledging the fact that it will probably not have a large effect on the Earth, but if everyone can just choose two of the options from the list, great progress will be made.

<p> <a name="q6"> <h1> What are we going to do with the profits? </h1> <br />All profits will be either: 1.) be reinvested back into the company or 2.) be used for environmental action. They will never be used for personal financial gain. </a> </p>
  <br />

  <br />
<p> <a name="future"> <h1> Future </h1> <br /> The future can go in any direction, but the one thing we hope and will try to achieve is for the future to be environmentally friendly. The end goal is to create a company that will make an actual positive impact on our environment, unlike the several promises that have been made to us. But I guess we all have to wait and see for only the future knows what is in store.

  <br />
<p> <a name="end"> <h1> Final Thoughts </h1> <br />We honestly do not care if other people attempt to copy our initiative because at the end of the day, they will only be helping the environment and that is a win for all of us. We will never give up!
